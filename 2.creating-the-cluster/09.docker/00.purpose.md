So in this section, we will be going through a Docker install.  If you don't know what Docker is, you can do some reading here (https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) at the overview where they discuss what Docker is, and the service it provides.  There is a ton of information out there about Docker, as well as containers, that you can read/watch and use to figure out if this might be something you want on your cluster.  

A brief run down of containers can be found here (https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/) which is also from Docker
