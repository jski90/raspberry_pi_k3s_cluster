So now we will move into installing Kubernetes on our cluster!  I have chosen to go with the lightweight version of Kubernetes called K3S, you can read more about K3S here (https://docs.k3s.io/).  There a lot of good information on the page, I highly recommend checking it out and looking through the menus and documentation as they go into a lot of depth on certain things.  

The reason for picking K3S is because I am using a cluster of Raspberry Pi's, which are small SBC's.  So if I can get similar functionality without stressing my hardware too hard to get it, then it makes it an easy choice for me.  I am trying to learn as much about Kubernetes as possible with the hardware that I have, so this seemed like the best route to go to accomplish that goal.

We will be moving into the actual install of K3S as we move forward from here, so get ready and lets get to it!
