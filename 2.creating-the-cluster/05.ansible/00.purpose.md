Now we will be moving on in our cluster creation, if you've made it this far following this guide you should have you Pi's with your OS installed and flashed on, and they should be able to be communicated with (which we verified with our ping command)!  Awesome job so far!

The purpose for us using Ansible in this scenario is it will allow us to execute commands across the cluster without having to SSH into each one to execute these commands.  This will save us a lot of time through the process when migrating things like SSH keys between nodes as well as executing commands for certain deployments/creations.  If you want to take a look at the Ansible documentation for yourself, you can find it [here](https://docs.ansible.com/) and I would suggest that you do because I am sure there are some really cool features that I will miss in this "walk-through". If you see a more efficient way to carry out some of these tasks, please feel free to let me know!  I've used this experience to learn some cool things about Ansible, but I am constantly trying to learn more ðŸ˜„.

Now lets move on to our use case for Ansible!
