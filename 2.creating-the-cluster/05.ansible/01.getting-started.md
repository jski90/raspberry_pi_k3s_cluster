We have no gotten logged into each of our nodes and configured our OS for all of them as well, congrats to you!  Before we can get plugging away with Ansible, there are some things we need to take care of first, **make sure you are logged into your "master" node for this step and logged into root user**:

**Step 1.** Navigate to our hosts file by using the command **cd /etc**

**Step 2.** Inside the /etc directory, we can use the command **ls -l** which will list all files within the directory (that aren't hidden, which we can use a different command for that, which we will cover later)

**Step 3.** Looking through your files, you should see a file named **hosts**, we will use the built-in editor "nano" to alter this file.  If you prefer to use a different editor, you're obviously more than welcome to do so.  The command should look like: **nano hosts**

**Step 4.** This will bring up the editor for the **hosts** file, we will be making some entries into this file, which will be as follows:

IP_FOR_MASTER_NODE MASTER_NODE_NAME MASTER_NODE_NAME.local **spaces inbetween each entry**

IP_FOR_WORKER_NODE WORKER_NODE_NAME WORKER_NODE_NAME.local **spaces inbetween each entry**

**We will repeat the worker node entry into the hosts file for all worker nodes that you have for your cluster. EX: If you have 1 master and 3 workers you should be adding 4 entries to this file in total.** 

Obviously you want to add the information that fits your nodes, which can vary depenidng on the IP addresses and naming convention you picked for your cluster.

**Step 5.** If you are new to "nano", to save and exit you will press **Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter**.  That will save the modified buffer, confirm the file name, and exit the editor

**Step 6.** Now we will do the fun part of installing Ansible by running the command: **apt install ansible**.  This should be a relatively quick install (a few minutes), and you will be prompted that the install will use XXXmb of additional disk space, so make sure you press **y and then Enter** to confirm
