This will be a quick section, but definitely necessary.  We need access to IP tables and K3S will also need access to IP tables.  So we will use Ansible to install them by running the following commands:

``ansible cube -m apt -a "name=iptables state=present" --become``

This will install the IP tables on all nodes.  You may see some messages pop up about SFTP transfer mechanism failing and SCP transfer mechanism failing, pay no mind to it.  We should see a wall of yellow text to show it has completed.

We will then need to reboot all nodes by running the following command:

``ansible workers -b -m shell -a "reboot"``

We will see a ``NODE_NAME | UNREACHABLE!`` message, which indicates they are rebooting.  The command has run through the shell and has begun the reboot process and Ansible is letting us know it has lost connection with them in that process.  We will also want to run ``reboot`` on our master as well.  Give it a minute and we can SSH back into our master (hopefully without the need for the password if we set up our SSH key properly ðŸ˜‰) and we will run one more command to make sure everything is back up and ready:

``ansible cube -m ping``

Everything should be up and running!

And that does it for this portion of the write-up!
