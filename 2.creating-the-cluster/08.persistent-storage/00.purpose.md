So now that we have Helm and Arkade installed, we are going to look at tackling the persistent storage issue that comes along with these types of clusters.  We obviously don't want to be constantly pushing read/write cycles onto our USB drive with our OS on it, because that could cause issues down the road with our OS failing and then losing everything.  So, if you followed my [hardware list file](https://github.com/jski90/raspberry_pi_k3s_cluster/blob/main/1.hardware-list/hardware.md) you'll have some extra USB drives to use for this purpose.  It allows us to have our files stored locally, and have them clustered as well, and also gives us a way to manage our storage witha  nicely packaged web UI.  I have done some research and eventually found a very comprensive guide that discussed some other options but out o fthe options listed, Longhorn made the most sense to me.  As I discussed in the hardware list write-up, you can either use the USB sticks or you can use an SSD.  There are separate steps for using the SSD but it is possible to do.  I will at lesat cover the installation of the USB sticks in my write-up.  

K3S also has a very thorough writeup of persistent volumes that is worth taking a look at [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/)

Lets move on ahead and get this started!
