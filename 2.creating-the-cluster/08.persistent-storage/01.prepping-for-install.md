So, we will be starting out our install of Longhorn with the creation of a directory for our default storage path.  Since we have Ansible installed, I have gone ahead and created a ``playbook`` which is a feature of Ansible that essentially allows us to execute commands in a script style format.  We will need to create this file on our master node and then execute the playbook, follow along to learn how ğŸ˜„.  

**Step 1.** Go here: (https://github.com/jski90/raspberry_pi_k3s_cluster/blob/main/configs/longhorn/directory-creation.yaml) to copy the ``directory-creation.yaml`` playbook file.  We will then navigate to our ansible directory and create the file:

- ``cd /etc/ansible``
- ``nano directory-creation.yaml``

**Step 2.** Paste the contents into your newly created file and then use **Cntrl+X, then Y, then Enter** to exit the nano editor.  Our file is now saved in our Ansible directory.  

**Step 3.** We can now use Ansible to execute this playbook!  To do this, we will use the command:

``ansible-playbook directory-creation.yaml``

Ansible will generate some output to your screen and if everything goes successful, you should see something along the lines of ``changed: [WORKER_NODE_NAME]`` for each node.  If this isn't successful for you, make sure you go back and ensure everything copied and pasted correctly from the directory-creation.yaml file I linked above.  Congratulations, you have created and executed your very first Ansible playbook!  

If you cannot get the Ansible command to work for you, you can always just SSH into each node individually and navigate to the proper directory and create the new directory manually, which I will list the steps for below:

- ``ssh root@WORKER_NODE_NAME``
- ``cd /var/lib/``
- ``mkdir longhorn``

We will need to repeat those steps for each worker node, **you only need to follow this last set of instructions if your ansible command failed.  If the ansible command was successful, then ansible did all of this for us ğŸ˜„.**  To learn more about Ansible Playbooks feel free to check out their documentation here: (https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks.html)

**Step 4.** Part of the installation prep for Longhorn is having open-iscsi installed and the daemon running on all nodes, as well as NFSv4 client.  We can take care of this quickly by running the following 3 commands and automating it with Ansible so we don't have to manually log into each node to accomplish this:

- ``ansible cube -b -m apt -a "name=open-iscsi state=present"``
- ``ansible cube -b -m apt -a "name=nfs-common state=present"``
- ``ansible cube -b -m apt -a "name=util-linux state=present"``

**Make sure you allow each command to complete before trying to run the next to ensure everything is done properly.**

**Step 5.** We will veryify that it installs by running: ``kubectl version``.  Expected output for server version should be >= v1.18 and <= v1.24.

That will take care of this section!  Congrats on getting all of this done ğŸ˜„.
