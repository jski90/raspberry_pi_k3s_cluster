If you've made it this far, you should have already installed your OS onto your nodes!  Congrats on that!

Now, we need to check and make sure that they are up and available and we can do that from our local machine.  At this point, if you have logged your IP addresses for your Pi's, this should be quite quick.

We will open our command prompt, or terminal depending on what OS you're using on your local machine and type in **ping IP_ADDRESS_FOR_YOUR_PI**.  If you're on a windows machine and want to keep pinging your Pi until you get a response, you'll add a **-t** flag at the end of your ping command.  For Linux OS, when you start receiving a response back from your Pi, you can press Control+C to get out of the ping sequence.

We will do this for each IP address for each Pi to verify they're all up and can be communicated with.  This will confirm that our configuration was successful and we are now ready to move on to the next step!
