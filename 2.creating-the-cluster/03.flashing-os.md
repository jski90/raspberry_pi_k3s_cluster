So now we have USB boot setup on all of our nodes.  So from this point we will be selecting which OS we want to choose.  I personally chose to use the DietPi OS because it is very lightweight (aligning with our lightweight install of K3S).  

You can find the image that I used by going to the DietPi website (https://dietpi.com/):
**Step 1.** Click "DOWNLOAD" at the top menu bar
**Step 2.** Selecting the hardware you will be using (Raspberry Pi for my use-case)
**Step 3.** Clicking the 64-bit image, which should prompt the download

Now we have the image downloaded you will need a program like 7zip to open it up, you will want to extract the .iso image

**Step 4.** We will now grab our USB drives and begin flashing our OS onto them for our initial boot
**Step 5.** You can use something along the lines of balenaEtcher to flash the image to your USB drives if you'd like, or you can do them individually
**Step 6.** Repeat this process for all drives you're planning on using

Once you have flashed all of your USB drives, we will be plugging them back into the computer to do some minor editing to make things a little easier for us to access everything.

**Step 7.** Now we have completed flashing our OS, we will plug the USB Drive back into our computer and open the file explorer, we will navigate to the 'dietpi.txt' file to set up our headless boot
**Step 8.**
