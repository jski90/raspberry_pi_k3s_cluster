OpenFaaS is an interesting piece of software, from their [official website](https://www.openfaas.com/) it is a framework for building serverless functions with Kubernetes.  I have seen some talk lately of big tech companies going to serverless services, and I thought this might be useful to learn.  So that's what we're going to do!  You obviously don't need to install OpenFaaS if you don't want it, but I'm going to try and learn as much about as much as I can during this process.  So, if you're wanting to try out OpenFaaS then lets go ahead and get started!
