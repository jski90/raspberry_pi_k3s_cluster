So now we have configured our load balancer, we will move on to installing and configuring a few more things.  We want to make sure we are on our master node logged in under the root user for this.  So lets begin!  If you want to learn more about Helm, you can check out the docs [here](https://helm.sh/docs/) as well as the installation instructions [here](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

**Step 1.** We will use ``cd`` to make sure we are in our root directory and we will create a directory for helm and then navigate to that helm directory:

- ``mkdir helm``
- ``cd helm``

**Step 2.** Now that we are in our helm directory, we will use ``curl`` to download everything, we will then modify the permission of the directory and then run the install script:

- ``curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3``
- ``chmod 700 get_helm.sh``
- ``./get_helm.sh``

After running the final command it will display that it is downloading and it will also display the default file path for the install which should be ``/usr/local/bin/helm``

**Step 3.** We verify our helm installation by running ``helm version`` which should display the currently installed version of helm on your screen

**Step 4.** We are now going to install Arkade, which is similar to Helm but a little more simple.  If you want to learn more about Arkade, you can check out the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/alexellis/arkade)  We will stay in our helm directory for this install:

- ``curl -SLsf https://dl.get-arkade.dev/ | sudo sh``

**Step 5.** We can verify our Arkade installation was successful by running: 

- ``arkade version``

We will go further in depth on what these will do for us in later sections, but it's important that we have them installed for now.  Congrats, you have just installed Helm and Arkade on your cluster!  Now lets move along :smile:.
