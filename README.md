# raspberry_pi_k3s_cluster

I will be creating this text to follow along and track the progress of my K3S Cluster install on my 4x Raspberry Pi 4B 4GB cluster.  I will do my best to include all components that I used to get everything assembled as well as all of the code I use to get everything deployed and working, doing my best to keep track of the errors I run into as well as the solutions I find and use to fix them.
