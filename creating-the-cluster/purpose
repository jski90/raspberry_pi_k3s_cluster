Purpose:

There are multiple purposes for me to create this cluster, the main of which is to have a very hands-on learning experience as I dive into the journey of learning Kubernetes and it's many use cases.  The cloud is incredibly fascinating to me, and I decided I wanted to get my hands on some hardware and take my shot at making one myself and I will add useful programs that I find uses for as I go along.  In the following files I will be adding installments of this process that I took to get my cluster up and running successfully, as well as issues I came across and how I managed to get through them.  Some reading this might already be K8S/K3S experts, but I had a small amount of exposure to this when I started and I wanted to provide a "guide" that can help newer people get into learning without it being so daunting.
